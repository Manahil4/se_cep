I see what you mean. It's important to balance the complexity of tasks to ensure that no single member is overwhelmed while others are underutilized. I'll adjust the plan so that each member has tasks of comparable complexity and can work in parallel effectively.

### **Revised Parallel Project Plan with Balanced Complexity**

### **Collaboration Tips:**

- **GitHub Workflow**: Ensure everyone is working on separate branches. Regularly merge and review code to avoid integration issues.
- **Daily Check-ins**: Brief daily meetings (10-15 minutes) to discuss progress and any blockers.
- **Documentation**: Keep thorough documentation of tasks and changes to ensure smooth handoffs and integration.
- **Testing**: Coordinate with each other to test features as they are completed to ensure they work well with the rest of the project.

By balancing the complexity and distributing tasks so that each member has comparable workloads, you can ensure a more efficient development process and manage the project more effectively within the given timeframe.
