Revised Parallel Project Plan with Low System Requirements Considerations (for Godot 4)
Week 1: Setup & Basic Mechanics
Member 1: Godot Setup & Basic Window
Tasks:
Install Godot 4 (use the lightweight 2D mode).
Set up a basic game window with the Godot 4 editor.
Document the setup and share the project framework with the team.
Complexity: Low (No heavy hardware usage).
Member 2: Player Movement & Input Handling
Tasks:
Implement basic player movement (left, right, jump).
Optimize for smooth performance on low-end systems.
Use placeholder assets for now (simple shapes).
Complexity: Medium (Minimal system resources needed).
Member 3: Basic Tilemap Creation
Tasks:
Create a basic tilemap with simple shapes.
Implement collision detection with tiles.
Keep assets light to avoid memory strain.
Complexity: Medium (Godotâ€™s tilemap system runs efficiently even on low-end systems).
Member 4: Basic Camera Implementation
Tasks:
Implement a basic camera to follow the player.
Ensure the camera moves smoothly with the player across the tilemap.
Complexity: Medium (Camera movement should not strain system resources).
Week 2: Core Mechanics & Game Elements
Member 1: Player Animations
Tasks:
Implement player animations using sprite sheets (walk, jump).
Ensure smooth transitions without taxing system performance.
Complexity: Medium (Keep sprite sheets small to avoid memory issues).
Member 2: Basic Enemy Logic
Tasks:
Implement basic enemy behavior (e.g., patrolling).
Keep the enemy logic light for the system.
Complexity: Medium.
Member 3: Enhanced Tilemap Features
Tasks:
Refine the tilemap system and ensure performance optimization.
Avoid adding too many tiles to keep memory usage low.
Complexity: Medium.
Member 4: Basic Level Design Tools
Tasks:
Begin creating basic level layouts (keep levels small for performance).
Focus on gameplay rather than adding unnecessary visual elements early on.
Complexity: Medium.
Week 3: Advanced Features & Optimization
Member 1: Sound Integration
Tasks:
Integrate simple sound effects (jump, stomp) and background music.
Use compressed audio formats to save memory.
Complexity: Medium (Low impact on system).
Member 2: Power-Ups & Items
Tasks:
Add simple power-ups like mushrooms and flowers.
Ensure the logic for pickups and transformations is light and optimized.
Complexity: Medium.
Member 3: Particle Effects
Tasks:
Keep particle effects simple (low particle count to avoid slowing down).
Use Godot's built-in particle system, but keep it efficient.
Complexity: Medium.
Member 4: Camera Features & Transitions
Tasks:
Refine the camera system, adding smooth transitions for player movement.
Ensure minimal impact on system resources.
Complexity: Medium.
Week 4: Final Touches & Optimization
Member 1: UI Design & Polish
Tasks:
Design a simple UI (start menu, pause menu) with lightweight assets.
Avoid overloading the UI with unnecessary visual elements.
Complexity: Medium.
Member 2: Game Testing & Bug Fixing
Tasks:
Run tests to ensure performance stability on low-end systems.
Focus on fixing bugs related to performance, such as memory leaks or slow frame rates.
Complexity: Medium to High (some issues may be harder to debug on a lower-spec machine).
Member 3: Packaging & Deployment
Tasks:
Ensure the game can be exported and run on low-spec systems (using Godot export options).
Focus on keeping the executable lightweight.
Complexity: Medium.
Member 4: Final Optimization & Clean Up
Tasks:
Optimize the project for smooth performance.
Remove unnecessary assets and scripts.
Complexity: Medium.
General Tips to Ensure Smooth Development on Your Core m3 7th Generation:
Optimize Assets: Use small sprite sheets and compress textures/audio to reduce memory usage.
Use Lightweight Features: Stick to basic 2D mechanics, avoiding advanced 3D features like Vulkan for now.
Disable Unnecessary Editor Features: Turn off editor previews, visual helpers, and real-time debugging if performance becomes sluggish.
Test Regularly: Frequently playtest small chunks of your game to avoid performance bottlenecks down the line.
With this adjusted plan, you should be able to develop your game without overloading your system, while still creating a polished, nostalgic platformer.
